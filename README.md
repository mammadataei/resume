# Mohammad's Resume

My resume generator using:

- [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) standard
- [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) for generating HTML
- [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) for generating PDF
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) for dev server
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling

Inspired By [Anthony Fu](https://github.com/antfu/resume) and
[Boilerplate theme for JSON Resume](https://github.com/jsonresume/jsonresume-theme-boilerplate)
