summary: Richard hails from Tulsa. He has earned degrees from the University of
  Oklahoma and Stanford. (Go Sooners and Cardinal!) Before starting Pied Piper,
  he worked for Hooli as a part time software developer. While his work focuses
  on applied information theory, mostly optimizing lossless compression schema of
  both the length-limited and adaptive variants, his non-work interests range widely,
  everything from quantum computing to chaos theory. He could tell you about it,
  but THAT would NOT be a “length-limited” conversation!
